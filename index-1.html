<h2 id="project-requirements">Project requirements</h2>
<p>Please adhere to the following manegerial requirements to make the project work
smoothly, speedily, and hopefully without problems:</p>
<h3 id="git-usage">Git usage</h3>
<p>All group members must create a github account and install git or Github Desktop and 
become collaborators to this repository. <strong>All changes you make during the day
should be committed and pushed to the repository!</strong> This will ensure both a paper-trail 
of your contributions and allows your research to remain easily identifyable; increasing 
the usefulness of the work you will do. See <a href="#setting-up-&amp;-using-git">Setting up &amp; using Git</a> 
for a tutorial on how to do this.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-procedure">Documentation procedure</h3>
<p>Any evidence identified from literature/schematic pictures, should be documented
<strong>verbatum</strong>: this means that for the documentation on the Github per
cytokine/hormone, you provide the sources, and literal text or pictures to
support your case. Of course in the report you must reference + summarize in your
own words (the reason for literal text is that checking and verifying the validity
of any cytokine- and hormone-tasks will be easier when I can read the text,
instead of searching within an article, with the added negative that in such a
case you might interpret literature differently from me and your peers). See
<a href="#example-case">Example Case</a> for an example of how to approach this, as well as how to
formulate the actual ouput.</p>
<h3 id="quality-assessment-procedure">Quality assessment procedure</h3>
<p>While I think these tasks can be tackled individually, it is up to you whether you
want to do so or go after these task in larger groups, all evidence must be
reviewed by at least a second assessor that was not involved in the original task
construction (by the first assessor(s)).  Second/third assessor will be working on
their own tasks and thus some waiting time can be expected. 
During review by the second assessor, the first assessor(s) can start with an
additional task. Similarly if a third assessor is necessary or my own input is 
required, both assessors will move on to another task and pick up their original 
task when reviewed/assessed. See <a href="#project-management">Choosing a task/project management</a> 
for how to indicate your involvement and sign-off. Make sure that in your commit 
messages for changes to git, if working in a group, you indicate all contributors' 
names (even if they did not commit/push anything themselves).
Assessment is based on the provided literature (and potentially some extra
googling, but they should be able to identify all information from the references
and verbatum documentation provided). They will then provide their assessment of
the following criteria:
- Correctness
  - Correct (they come to the same conclusions)
  - Unclear (different conclusions but original does not seem incorrect)
  - Full disagreement (the "first assessor(s)" missed something or made a mistake)</p>
<p>In case everything is correct, no other actions have to be taken and both first
and second assessor can continue with another task. When there is disagreement
but no obvious correct answer, the first and second assessors will attempt a
second search. If such a search does not yield new results/insights, they will
attempt to clarify the contradicting points and ask a third assessor to indicate
whether the problems are clearly defined. If this is the case, contact me
(Jelle.bonthuis@maastrichtuniversity.nl, or come by my office), indicating the
Github page with the evidence and all assessors can move on to another task
during my review. If my review indicates more work needs to be done, the first
assessors are responsible, and the second assessor will come in once again when
they are done.
In the unlikely case (hopefully) that the evidence seems to be completely wrong
(not the correct genes, entirely misinterpretted, different organisms etc), the
second assessor is responsible for providing in-depth commentary on what needs
to be changed, and the first assessor(s) will take this to continue and improve
their work.
- Documentation: 
  - Fully documented and clearly/logically summarised (including table of
        reactions, genes involved, and numbers refering to the verbatum text from
        literature somewhere else in the document).
  - Fully documented but difficult to navigate all relevant information
  - Not all information was present, or logical leaps in how one piece of
          evidence leads to another
  - Mostly or entirely lacking </p>
<p>In case everything is fully documented and logically structured, no changes are
necessary. If fully documented but too much irrelevant inforomation is present,
or overall structure is difficult to disentangle, the second assessor provides
tips and high priority changes that are necessary in order for the documentation
to be useful for people not in the project - high priority is key; this does not
need to become an academic paper, it should be formatted/changes up to the point
that in a year, I can browse/peruse the results and easily find anything I need.
In case not all information was present, or some evidence appears to be missing,
this should be clearly communicated to the first assessors, and changed (as this
can easily lead to incorrect results or wrong interpretations).
In the unfortunate case of almost no documentation, refer to the
<a href="#example-case">Example Case</a>, provide written feedback to first assessors 
to help them on their way to fully document whatever is necessary.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-and-using-git">Setting up and using Git</h2>
<p>Git is the most-used type of version control (the ability to see previous versions, and
to "go back" to them without necessarily losing other progress). Especially in
programming/software projects where multiple people work together and might all edit
similar code/files, this became crucial. See this (somewhat not-serious video) that
explains how useful this was: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaEnUXtiGsE"><img alt="Video" src="https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/iaEnUXtiGsE/maxresdefault.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3 id="create-a-github-account">Create a Github account</h3>
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github">here</a>
(I recommend using your personal email, as your university email will eventually 
become inaccessible).</li>
<li>Become collaborator </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installing-git">Installing Git</h3>
<p>If you are a Linux user, I assume you can follow the instructions <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a>. </p>
<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>
<p>Installing Git on Windows is straightforward: 
 - Download the latest version of <em>Git for Windows</em> <a href="https://gitforwindows.org">here</a>
 - Follow the installer instructions, and if given the option, choose to use Git Bash instead of the standard Git Windows Command Prompt.
 - After installation is complete, verify that it is working by opening Git Bash and typing <code>git --version</code>; you should see <code>git version 2.45.1.windows.1</code> or something similar.</p>
<p>(Optionally) If you rather use a GUI instead of having to use the command line, you can
 install Github Desktop - <em>in addition to Git, <strong>not</strong> as a substitute</em>; do note that
 while this is easier 95% of the time you might run into an issue and will require Git 
 Bash, and learning the few Git commands you need won't hurt you (and is valuable 
 in many settings).
 - https://desktop.github.com/download/
 - Follow the setup instructions
 - Login to your Github </p>

<h3 id="setting-it-up">Setting it up</h3>
<p>Once you have it all installed, it is time to down</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-git">How to use Git</h3>
<p>The way of using Git (regarldless of whether you are using Github Desktop, or Git from
command-line interfaces) is to "fetch" (find new changes), "pull" (copy those changes to
your own device), and then after you make changes, you "push" (add changes the central
directory). In this manner, everyone has a central repository, but can make changes
independelty. When you and someone else make changes to the same file, you will be asked
to make a concious decision on how to "merge" those changes. In addition there will be a
complete history of all changes you all make to each file.</p>

<h2 id="example-case">Example Case</h2>
<p>Below is an example of how a cas</p>
<h3 id="_1"></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#example-case">Example Case</a></li>
<li>
<p><a href="#taking-the-case">Taking the task</a>
    On the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_SG6BUYSQPkR_8MzOA8YLUAw2p9PgF1CSNdOy6dspm4/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> we can find the tasks, and their status.
    First you check the list and find a peptide hormone or cytokine that you are
    interested in. A task has a status and it should not be taken by anyone. Select that
    you are working by writing "First assessment (inital, lastname" in the Active/Stage
    column. Put your name (or names in case you are doing this as a group), in the
    "First assessor" column. </p>
<p>Now create a folder on your computer, in your <em>cloned</em> and <em>pulled</em> git directory, in the Tasks folder,
here we will work on Task 701, insulin synthesis, so inside Tasks I added
"Task_701_insulin_synthesis". I fill it with copies of the three files in the
"Current_files" folder (remember to copy, not remove)! We then create two Word (or
other text-related files), the main literature file: Insulin_synthesis_task_701.docx
&amp; the shortened notes file: Short_notes_Task_701_insulin_synthesis.docx. As the main
literature file can become quite large (as you will see), the short notes file
is there to write down any of the most important things to consider (such as some
things we aren't very sure about, or that should maybe in the future be further
explored).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#finding-appropriate-literature">Finding appropriate literature</a>
      Now we need go about finding appropriate literature, which starts with finding the
      gene of the actual pre-pro-insulin; subsequently it's time to start reading some
      articles on the biosynthesis and processing. At this stage it is reccomended to
      read/skim a few different (review) articles to get a bit of an overview (one might go
      into more detail than others). Another important thing to not forget is looking up
      pictures on google images: often schematic overviews provide additional information
      which we can then later on look into. Be mindful of any mentions of genes and
      processes involved, as we will need to collate them in their entirety.</p>
<p>Please see the case report I prepared in Task_701_insulin_synthesis, go through it
  carefully. I wrote it not entirely as I would like to see it from you, some of the
  order and overall flow is not in logical order for someone else to read in the
  future. However this is the order by which I found things, and hope to show how I
  often missed things which when reading/looking up other articles then came to
  light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#documenting-the-evidence">Documenting the evidence</a>
      You will then search, puzzle, and document out the case, as well as creating the
      files containing the metabolites and reactions. In case there are any useful (used
      by other groups, such as general pathways) things, add their GPRs directly to the
      GPR sheet in the same spreadsheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#calling-for-review">Calling for review</a>
     When you feel like you are done, upload all the files by perfomring the following
     git commands (if you added your files in your git directory): 
     ``` bash</p>
<p>git add .
 git commit -m "feat(task 701): added first assessment of task 701"
 git pull
 git push
 <code></code>
 ``` </p>
<p>Then we change the spreadsheet (and possibly say something in the WhatsApp group,
 or whoever is next to you, in case you are working at the same location). Put your
 status to "Awaiting second assessor", possibly take a break, but don't wait just on
 the second assessor (that might take a while) and move on to the next task. Or in
 case another group is awaiting assessment, you can take that task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#performing-review-assessment">Performing review assessment</a>
    Now you are reviewing another group's or person's work; open up git bash and pull
    the changes:
     <code>bash
     git pull</code>
    You should now see their task folder and documentation appear on your own computer
    and you go through their documentation. 
    Check if you follow all the steps based on the evidence they
    provided, did they miss anything, are there any leaps in logic? Are there things
    that you know (from your own task) that might have not been considered in enough
    detail? </p>
<p>Based on the quality of the work (interpretation, completeness), and the
documentation (logical, no leaps, easily followable), you then write your review in
a document called "peer_review". Write out clearly what needs to changed or looked
back into and upload that to the git in the same way as before. That way they can
address each point, possibly argue with you and summarise the changes they make to
the documents. Remember to also check their metabolites and reactions files, as
eventually my scripts will look into those to grab all the things you defined
together. </p>
