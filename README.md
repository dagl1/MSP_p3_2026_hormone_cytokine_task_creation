# Creating cytokine and peptide hormone-releasal metabolic tasks

This document provides the infortation required to succesfully pursue the MSP project and therefore should be read carefully. While most decisions in how you go about this are your own, some project/managerial requirements exist from my end, namely:

- All group members must create a github account and install git or Github Desktop and become collaborators to this repository. **All changes you make during the day should be committed and pushed to the repository!** This will ensure both a paper-trail of your contributions and allows your research to remain easily identifyable; increasing the usefulness of the work you will do. See [[Setting up and using Git]] for a tutorial on how to do this.

- Any evidence identified from literature/schematic pictures, should be documented
      **verbatum**: this means that for the documentation on the Github per
      cytokine/hormone, you provide the sources, and literal text or pictures to
      support your case. Of course in the report you must reference + summarize in your
      own words (the reason for literal text is that checking and verifying the validity
      of any cytokine- and hormone-tasks will be easier when I can read the text,
      instead of searching within an article, with the added negative that in such a
      case you might interpret literature differently from me and your peers). See
      [[Example Case]] for an example of how to approach this, as well as how to
      formulate the actual ouput.

- While I think these tasks can be tackled individually, it is up to you whether you
      want to do so or go after these task in larger groups, all evidence must be
      reviewed by at least a second assessor that was not involved in the original task
      construction (by the first assessor(s)).  Second/third assessor will be working on
      their own tasks and thus some waiting time can be expected. 
      During review by the second assessor, the first assessor(s) can start with an
      additional task. Similarly if a third assessor is necessary or my own input is 
      required, both assessors will move on to another task and pick up their original 
      task when reviewed/assessed. See [[Project management and sign-off]] for how to
      indicate your involvement and sign-off. Make sure that in your commit messages for
      changes to git, if working in a group, you indicate all contributors' names (even
      if they did not commit/push anything themselves).
      Assessment is based on the provided literature (and potentially some extra
      googling, but they should be able to identify all information from the references
      and verbatum documentation provided). They will then provide their assessment of
      the following criteria:

  -- Correctness:
        --- Correct (they come to the same conclusions)
        --- Unclear (different conclusions but original does not seem incorrect)
        --- Full disagreement (the "first assessor(s)" missed something or made
        a mistake)
        In case everything is correct, no other actions have to be taken and both first
        and second assessor can continue with another task. When there is disagreement
        but no obvious correct answer, the first and second assessors will attempt a
        second search. If such a search does not yield new results/insights, they will
        attempt to clarify the contradicting points and ask a third assessor to indicate
        whether the problems are clearly defined. If this is the case, contact me
        (Jelle.bonthuis@maastrichtuniversity.nl, or come by my office), indicating the
        Github page with the evidence and all assessors can move on to another task
        during my review. If my review indicates more work needs to be done, the first
        assessors are responsible, and the second assessor will come in once again when
        they are done.
        In the unlikely case (hopefully) that the evidence seems to be completely wrong
        (not the correct genes, entirely misinterpretted, different organisms etc), the
        second assessor is responsible for providing in-depth commentary on what needs
        to be changed, and the first assessor(s) will take this to continue and improve
        their work.
    -- Documentation: 
        --- Fully documented and clearly/logically summarised (including table of
        reactions, genes involved, and numbers refering to the verbatum text from
        literature somewhere else in the document).
        --- Fully documented but difficult to navigate all relevant information
        --- Not all information was present, or logical leaps in how one piece of
        evidence leads to another
        --- Mostly or entirely lacking 
        In case everything is fully documented and logically structured, no changes are
        necessary. If fully documented but too much irrelevant inforomation is present,
        or overall structure is difficult to disentangle, the second assessor provides
        tips and high priority changes that are necessary in order for the documentation
        to be useful for people not in the project - high priority is key; this does not
        need to become an academic paper, it should be formatted/changes up to the point
        that in a year, I can browse/peruse the results and easily find anything I need.
        In case not all information was present, or some evidence appears to be missing,
        this should be clearly communicated to the first assessors, and changed (as this
        can easily lead to incorrect results or wrong interpretations).
        In the unfortunate case of almost no documentation, refer to the [[Example
        Case]], provide written feedback to first assessors to help them on their way to
        fully document whatever is necesary.
